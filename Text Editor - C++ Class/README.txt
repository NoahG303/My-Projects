For this project, we were given a GUI for a text editor, but had to implement all of the actual features (in C++).

Our job was to implement 3 classes:
First, the StudentTextEditor class, which implemented the actual text editor functions (add/remove characters, load/save files, navigate the editor, etc)
Second, the StudentUndo class, which implemented undo capabilities
Last, the StudentSpellCheck class, which would provide real-time spell check and suggestions, highlighting misspelled words as well as recommending proper spellings of words that were one character off.

Our classes were derived from framework classes that we were provided with, as well as a main.cpp, etc.

With our created classes connected to the framework, we had a functional word processor!
