For this project, we were given the framework for a game, and a spec for how the various NPC characters should behave and interact in different situations, and our job was to implement them as described.

Classes were inherited from very basic base classes given to us, to ensure they would work with the given framework and assets (sound, visuals, etc).

Our job was to intelligently design a multitude of classes, private variables, and member functions, as well as use inheritance to minimize duplicated code.
